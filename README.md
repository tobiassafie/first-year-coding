# first-year-coding
Simulations, models, and visualizations from a first-year Physics, Economics & Mathematics student

Despite receiving a D+ in my introduction Python class at Drexel, I have been coding in Python, Java, and Go for years, even receiving a 5 on the AP CS A exam.
Since arriving at Drexel, I have been programming computational physics simulations, small Python assignments, and personal projects that can be employed in social equity research.

## Physics Simulations
I made these in the following core Physics courses at Drexel: Contemporary Physics I, II, III, and Computational Physics I. These projects were developed using Jupyter Notebooks and VPython to model real physical systems. Jupyter allowed for interactive, step-by-step development, while VPython made it easy to animate and actually visualize 3D simulations.


### Einstein Solid Model
Simlates energy distribution in a two-particle Einstein solid using discrete energy quanta, Includes entropy calculations, multiplicity tracking, and optional plots to visualize system behavior over time.

### E-Field Simulator
Simulates and models the electric field generated by a charged ring, disk, and parallel-plate capacitor using VPython. Users can click to set observation points and visualize the resulting field vectors.
(N.B. The simulation is slow and runs a little funky due to VPython's constraints. Could be further optimized to run more efficiently)

### Three Body Problem
Numerically simulates the gravitational interaction between three celestial bodies. Users can click to set the inital position of the third body to begin the simulation.

## Personal Projects

### Reverse Redlining in Philadelphia
Data-driven visualization of modern redlining and housing inequity in Philadelphia. Uses demographic and historical housing data to explore patterns of systemic inequity.
N.B. I built this program to build off the research paper I published to Drexel's student research anthology in my Fall term. Both as someone from North Philadelphia and as a general Philadelphia resident, I think it is paramount to address the current process of gentrification and discrimination in our home in order to build a more equitable, fairer, and kinder city.

### Flappy Bird
A rough recreation of Flappy Bird. It features my own 3D models and incorporates realistic gravity (negligible drag and arbitrary impulse-based lift).
N.B. I made this during my Fall term to help familiarize myself with VPython.

## Short Python Assignments
I coded a handful of short assignments in my intro Python class at Drexel, and although not very impressive, I figured I'd showcase some of the key concepts we covered.
